# A. Constructible Numbers

## Q1

Measure the compass radius with from points $(0, 0)$ to $(b, 0)$ and put the center on $(a, 0)$, then draw out a circle. Where the circle intersects the line OI is at the point $(a + b, 0)$.

Likewise this time go backwards from $(a, 0)$ and you will get $(a - b, 0)$.

## Q2

Because the lines of the triangles are parallel, they are similar, and the ratios between both sides are constant.

This triangle can be constructed using parallel line constructions (see on YouTube).

$$\frac{a}{1} = \frac{x}{b} \implies x = ab$$

Since we can construct $x$, so $ab \in \mathbb{D}$.

## Q3

Apply the same argument as above but swap the labels for $x$ and $a$ around, obtaining the ratio $x = a / b$.

## Q4

From Thales theorem, the angle where $x$ intersects the circle is a right angled triangle. Call this point $C$. Call the point $(1, 0)$ as $O$.

Angle $ACO$ is the same as $CBO$, and so also $CAO$ and $BCO$. Therefore the triangles are similar and the ratio of their sides is constant.

$$\frac{x}{a} = \frac{1}{x} \implies x^2 = a$$
Since $x \in \mathbb{D}$ and $x = \sqrt{a}$, so $\sqrt{a} \in \mathbb{D}$.

## Q5

$\mathbb{D}$ contains all the integers and ratios between those integers which is the definition of $\mathbb{Q}$.

## Q6

Take a monic polynomial and
$$(x + \frac{a_1}{2})^2 - \frac{a_1^2}{4} + a_0 = 0$$
$$x = \sqrt{\frac{a_1^2}{4} - a_0} - \frac{a_1}{2} \in \mathbb{D}$$

# B. Constructible Points and Constructible Numbers

## Q1

Use parallel line construction (see youtube for howto) to construct parallel lines crossing $a$ and $b$. Where the lines intersect is $(a, b)$.

See the answer for Q3 mistakenly which is actually for this question.

## Q2

$P$ is constructible from $\{O,I\} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$.

## Q3

Just with $\{O, I\}$ we can construct the entire set of integers along the x axis.

We can also split segments in half using a compass and so move along the y axis.

From part A, we then have all the field operations, and since $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{D}$, so we have the entire space of $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$.

## Q4

Since $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$ is constructible from $\{O, I\}$, so therefore any point constructible from $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$ would be an extension of $\{O, I\}$.

## Q5

$P$ is constructible and so are its coordinates.

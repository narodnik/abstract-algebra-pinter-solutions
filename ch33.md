# A. Finding Radical Extensions

## Q1

### a

\begin{alignat*}{2}
L_1 &= \mathbb{Q}(\alpha_0), & \quad \alpha_0^2 &= 5 \in \mathbb{Q} \\
L_2 &= L_1(\alpha_1),        & \quad \alpha_1^5 &= 2 \in L_1 \\
L_3 &= L_2(\alpha_2),        & \quad \alpha_2^4 &= 3 \in L_2 \\
L_4 &= L_3(\alpha_3),        & \quad \alpha_3^3 &= 4 \in L_3 \\
\end{alignat*}

### b

\begin{alignat*}{2}
L_1 &= \mathbb{Q}(\alpha_0), & \quad \alpha_0^9 &= 2 \in \mathbb{Q} \\
L_2 &= L_1(\alpha_1),        & \quad \alpha_1^2 &= 5 \in L_1 \\
L_3 &= L_2(\alpha_2),        & \quad \alpha_2^3 &= 1 - \sqrt{5} \in L_2 \\
L_4 &= L_3(\alpha_3),        & \quad \alpha_3^2 &= \frac{1 - \alpha_0}{\alpha_2} \in L_3 \\
\end{alignat*}

### c

\begin{alignat*}{2}
L_1 &= \mathbb{Q}(i), & \quad i^2 &= 1 \in \mathbb{Q} \\
L_2 &= L_1(\alpha_1),        & \quad \alpha_1^2 &= 3 \in L_1 \\
L_3 &= L_2(\alpha_2),        & \quad \alpha_2^2 &= 11 \in L_2 \\
L_4 &= L_3(\alpha_3),        & \quad \alpha_3^5 &= \frac{(\alpha_1 - 2i)^3}{i - \alpha_2} \in L_3 \\
\end{alignat*}

## Q2

### a

The polynomial $2x^5 - 5x^4 + 5$ is irreducible by Eisenstein's criteria using divisor $5$ given that $5 \mid a_i : i \neq 5$, $5 \nmid a_5$, and $5^2 \nmid a_0$.

```python
sage: plot(2 * x ^ 5 + 5 * x ^ 4 + 5, (-2.6, 1))
```

![](img/33-2a-graph.png)

Point of inflection at $(0, 5)$.

```python
sage: diff(2 * x ^ 5 + 5 * x ^ 4 + 5)
10*x^4 + 20*x^3
sage: solve(_, x)
[x == -2, x == 0]
sage: a = 2 * x ^ 5 + 5 * x ^ 4 + 5
sage: a(x=-2), a(x=0)
(21, 5)
```

Minimum is $(0, 5)$ and maximum is $(-2, 21)$.

$a(x)$ thus only crosses the x-axis once and has one real root $r_1$, and four complex roots $r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5$ with $r_2, r_3$ and $r_4, r_5$ being complex conjugates of each other.

The permutation group of $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5$ which is $\mathbf{G}$ is a subgroup of $S_5$.

Since $a(x)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}$, so $[\mathbb{Q}(r_1): \mathbb{Q}] = 5$. So $5$ is a factor of $[K: \mathbb{Q}]$. Thus $\mathbf{G}$ contains an element of order 5.

The automorphism $(r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4)$ has order 4, $(r_1 r_2 r_3)$ has order 3, $(r_1 r_2 r_3)(r_4 r_5)$ order 6, which only leaves the cycle of length 5 $(r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4 r_5)$ which has order 5. Thus $\mathbf{G}$ contains an automorphism which is a cycle permutation of the roots $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5$ of length 5.

From 8H5, we saw that a transposition $(12)$ and a cycle $(12345)$ will generate $S_5$. The proof follows: $(12345)(12)(12345)^{-1} = (23), (12)(23)(12) = (13)$. Repeating the process we get $(12345)(13)(12345)^{-1} = (24), (12)(24)(12) = (14), (12345)(14)(12345)^{-1} = (25), (12)(25)(12) = (15)$. Finally the set $T_1 = \{ (12), (13), \dots, (15) \}$ generates $S_5$.

Thus $\mathbf{G} = S_5$ and since $S_5$ is not solvable, there is no radical solution for $a(x)$.

## b

```python
sage: a = x ^ 5 - 4 * x ^ 2 + 2
sage: diff(a)
5*x^4 - 8*x
sage: solve(_, x)
[x == 1/5*5^(2/3)*(I*sqrt(3) - 1), x == 1/5*5^(2/3)*(-I*sqrt(3) - 1), x == 2/5*5^(2/3), x == 0]
```

```python
sage: plot(a, (-1, 2))
```

![](img/33-2b-graph.png)

The graph has a maximum at $x = 0$, and a minimum at $x = \frac{2}{5} \sqrt[3]{5}^2$. $a(x)$ crosses
the x-axis 3 times and so has two imaginary roots.

By the [complex conjugate root theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate_root_theorem),
the complex roots of $a(x)$ are conjugate pairs. Therefore $a(x)$ has three real roots, and two imaginary
roots. By the reasoning in the question above, there is a cycle of length 5 and a transposition between
the imaginary roots.

Thus the group for $a(x)$ is $S_5$ which is unsolvable implying there is no radical solution.

## c

```python
sage: a = x ^ 5 - 4 * x ^ 4 + 2 * x + 2
sage: ad = diff(a)
sage: sols = solve(ad, x)

We can see from the differentiated curve, that $a(x)$ is decreasing below $x = -1$ and increasing above $x = 4$.
Thus it crosses the x-axis three times, and so has three real roots, and two imaginary roots.

By the argument before this implies the group for this curve is $S_5$ which is unsolvable.

## Q3

$$a(x) = (x - 2)^5 - (x - 2)$$
Let $a(x) = 0$ then
$$(x - 2)^4 = 1$$
The fourth roots of $1$ are $\pm i, \pm 1$. The remaining root of $a(x)$ is $x = 2$.
All these roots are real and solvable.

## Q4

Substituting $y = x^2$, we get $a(x) = ay^4 + by^3 + cy^2 + dy + e$ which is easily solvable.
Any solution is then solvable for $x$ since $x = \pm \sqrt{y}$ which is itself a solvable equation.

## Q5

There is no general solution for polynomials of degree 5, but there are polynomials of degree 5 which
have a solvable group.

# B. Solvable Groups

## Q1

Every subgroup of an abelian group is a normal subgroup.

Let $G$ be an abelian group with $x \in G$, and $H$ a subgroup with $a \in H$. Since $xax^{-1} = axx^{-1} = a \in H$, $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

The set of commutators for an abelian group is $\{ e \} \implies Hxyx^{-1}y^{-1} = Hxy(yx)^{-1} = H \implies Hxy = Hyx \implies G/H$ is abelian.

From these two derivable properties of an abelian group, we see that every abelian group is also a solvable group.

## Q2

The intersection of two subgroups of $G$ is a subgroup of $G$. For example $e \in J_0 = K \cap H_0$. For any $a \in J_0$, both $K$ and $H_0$ contain $a^{-1} \implies a^{-1} \in J_0$, likewise for products $a, b \in J_0 \implies ab \in J_0$.

All the iterated groups $J_i$ are subgroups of $K$, with $J_i \triangleleft J_{i + 1}$. Observe that $J_{i + 1}$ is a subgroup of $H_{i + 1}$. Let $x \in J_{i + 1}, a \in J_i$ then $xax^{-1} \in K \cap H_i = J_i$. Thus $J_i$ is a normal subgroup of $J_{i + 1}$.

Thus the sequence $J_0, \dots, J_n$ is a normal series of $K$.

## Q3

$H_{i + 1} / H_i$ is abelian $\implies$ $H_i$ contains all the commutators $xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \in H_{i + 1}$. Let $x, y \in J_{i + 1}$, then $xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \in J_{i + 1}$ and also $K$. Observe $xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \in H_i \cap K = J_i \implies J_{i + 1} / J_i$ is abelian. Thus the series $\{ e \} = J_0 \triangleleft J_1 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft J_n = K$ is a solvable series of $K$.

## Q4

Combining the above two parts, we see that given a solvable group, any subgroup $K \subseteq G$ is also a solvable group.

## Q5

$S_3$, the [dihedral group of order 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group_of_order_6) has six elements generated by $\langle a, b \rangle = \{ e, \alpha = a, 
\beta = b, \delta = aba, \kappa = ab, \gamma = ba \}$. The subgroup $\{ e, \beta = b, \delta = aba \}$
$$\alpha^{-1} = \alpha \quad \beta^{-1} = \delta \quad \gamma^{-1} = \gamma$$
$$\delta^{-1} = \beta \quad \kappa^{-1} = \kappa$$
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\alpha \beta \alpha^{-1}    &= \alpha \beta \alpha      &= \alpha \kappa    &= \delta \\
\kappa \beta \kappa^{-1}    &= \kappa \beta \kappa      &= \kappa \gamma    &= \delta \\
\gamma \beta \gamma^{-1}    &= \gamma \beta \gamma      &= \gamma \alpha    &= \delta \\
\alpha \delta \alpha^{-1}   &= \alpha \delta \alpha     &= \alpha \gamma    &= \beta \\
\kappa \delta \kappa^{-1}   &= \kappa \delta \kappa     &= \kappa \alpha    &= \beta \\
\gamma \delta \gamma^{-1}   &= \gamma \delta \gamma     &= \gamma \kappa    &= \beta \\
\end{alignat*}
So $\{ \epsilon, \beta, \delta \}$ absorbs products from $S_3$ and is a normal subgroup. Since $S_3$ has a solvable series, we conclude $S_3$ is a solvable group, and by part 4, that every subgroup is also solvable.

## Q6

$$B = \{ e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23) \}$$
$$A_4 = \{ e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23), (13)(12), (12)(13), (14)(13), (13)(14), (14)(12), (12)(14), (24)(23), (23)(24) \}$$
$$[S_4: A_4] = 2$$
Every index 2 subgroup is abelian.

$B$ is the Klein subgroup of $A_4$ which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. It is an abelian normal subgroup. Therefore also $A_4/B$ is abelian.
